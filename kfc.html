                        <p>KFC is an American fast food restaurant chain headquartered in Louisville, 
                        Kentucky that specializes in fried chicken. It is the world's second-largest 
                        restaurant chain (as measured by sales) after McDonald's, with 22,621 locations 
                        globally in 150 countries as of December 2019. The chain is a subsidiary of 
                        Yum! Brands, a restaurant company that also owns the Pizza Hut, Taco Bell 
                        and WingStreet chains.  </p>

                        <p>KFC was founded by Colonel Harland Sanders, an entrepreneur who began selling fried 
                            chicken from his roadside restaurant in Corbin, Kentucky during the Great Depression. 
                            Sanders identified the potential of the restaurant franchising concept and the first 
                            "Kentucky Fried Chicken" franchise opened in Utah in 1952. KFC popularized chicken in 
                            the fast-food industry, diversifying the market by challenging the established dominance 
                            of the hamburger. By branding himself as "Colonel Sanders", Harland became a prominent 
                            figure of American cultural history and his image remains widely used in KFC advertising 
                            to this day. However, the company's rapid expansion overwhelmed the aging Sanders and 
                            he sold it to a group of investors led by John Y. Brown Jr. and Jack C. Massey in 1964.</p>

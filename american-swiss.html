                        <p>At American Swiss, we create jewelry that is inspired by life and its precious moments, 
                            with quality at the heart of everything we do. Every detail of our fine jewelry is 
                            carefully considered. The ultimate luxury is knowing how your piece has been created. 
                            Formed under immense pressure, hundreds of kilometers below the surface of the earth, 
                            a natural Diamond's one-billion-year journey is nothing short of miraculous. 
                            They were first discovered in India over two thousand years ago and have remained a 
                            symbol of beauty, love and abundance ever since. </p>

                        <p>Diamonds are highly regarded for their magnificence and ability to reflect light in 
                            an extremely dazzling way. Created out of pure carbon, the carbon atoms within 
                            Diamonds are bonded very strongly, making them one of the hardest substances known to man. 
                            All American Swiss Diamonds half a carat and above are independently certified and are 
                            accompanied by a certificate detailing exact measurements, color, clarity, carat weight, 
                            cut and features.</p>

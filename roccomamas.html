                        <p>Founded in July 2013, RocoMamas has fast become one of the trendiest restaurants in South Africa, 
                        garnering a loyal following of burger enthusiasts. Their brand position of “Not Normal” is evident 
                        in their funky décor, rock ‘n roll vibe, unique menu items and an open-style kitchen where customers 
                        can see (and smell) the meals being prepared. This new concept is a result of the growing appetite 
                        for hand-made food and a more personalised dining experience. Customers can sit down and soak up 
                        the laid-back vibe with a burger and craft beer or choose to order a takeout thanks to the speedy 
                        service. RocoMamas has a menu that goes far beyond your typical burger joint; 
                        it’s all about customisation.</p>

                        <p>Famous for their artisanal style “Smashburgers”, the franchise also serves chicken wings 
                            and ribs as their core offering. The Smashburger concept refers to the process of smashing 
                            a ball of ground beef o‌n a hot grill to seal in the juices, rather than squeezing them out. 
                            This results in a medium to well-done burger that is very juicy. Many customers will testify 
                            that once you’ve tasted a Smashburger, there’s no going back to ‘normal’ – something that 
                            RocoMamas prides itself on not being. The RocoMamas concept was launched by Brian Altriche, 
                            who has grown RocoMamas to more than 75 restaurants throughout the country and 17 international 
                            restaurants, located in Australia, Namibia, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Mauritius, the Middle East and 
                            recently opened its first outlets in Cyprus and India. Spur Corporation acquired the majority 
                            stake in RocoMamas in March 2015.</p>
